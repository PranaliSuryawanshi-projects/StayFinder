#  StayFinder ‚Äì React + Tailwind Property Rental (Dummy Project)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
> This is a **dummy frontend project** created purely for learning purposes. I'm currently learning React and Tailwind CSS by building real-world UIs inspired by platforms like Airbnb.

##  Overview

StayFinder is a clone-style frontend project of a property rental platform. It lets users explore listings, apply search filters, view property details, and simulate bookings. There‚Äôs also a fake authentication modal to mimic user login/signup behavior.

This project was built while following YouTube tutorials to improve my skills in:

- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Component structuring
- UI/UX best practices
